title: Dangerous transforms
---

Certain ES2015 features are useful, but costly to convert to ES5 while adhering closely to spec. In these cases, Bubl√© offers 'dangerous transforms', which generate highly efficient ES5 code but with important caveats.

Enable these by adding them to the `transforms` option (see [Command line options](#command-line-options) or [Using the JavaScript API](#using-the-javascript-api)).


### `dangerousForOf`

```js
// in
for ( let div of document.querySelectorAll( 'div' ) ) {
  div.style.backgroundColor = randomColor();
}

// out
for ( var i = 0, list = document.querySelectorAll( 'div' ); i < list.length; i += 1 ) {
  var div = list[i];

  div.style.backgroundColor = randomColor();
}
```

The ES6 `for-of` statement works with *iterable values*, which includes any `Array`, `String`, `Map`, `Set`, or `NodeList` (think `document.querySelectorAll('div')`), but also any other object with a `[Symbol.iterator]` method, or the return value of a generator function.

Since collections (`Map`, `Set` etc), `Symbol`, and generators aren't supported in ES5 environments, they are not supported by `dangerousForOf`. Instead, it will assume the *iterable value* to be just an array-like object with `length` property, this includes arrays, strings and nodelists.

This is very similar to the [approach taken by TypeScript](https://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/content/docs/for...of.html). Unless you're doing something crazy, code written with this transformation in mind will continue to work when you stop using it in favour of using native `for-of` support.


### `dangerousTaggedTemplateString`

```js
// in
get`http://example.com/foo?bar=${bar + baz}&quux=${quux}`;

// out
get([ "http://example.com/foo?bar=", "&quux=", "" ], bar + baz, quux );
```

This differs from spec in that the first argument to `get` doesn't have a `raw` property. The vast majority of custom template string interpolators (e.g. `get` in this case) don't use `raw`, and so simply passing an array of string literals is fine.

Custom string interpolators that work with `dangerousTaggedTemplateString` will continue to work when you stop transpiling template strings altogether.
